    <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;"><img style="margin-left: 170px; float:left; padding-right: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;" src="me.jpeg" width="330"; height="420">Hi! I'm Cindy. I'm in my 2B term in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've had three co-op terms so far, and have worked in web development/design, 
        software development, and QA. I'd love to experience a more design-centric internship and am particularly interested in UI/UX, product design, and industrial design. </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Having enrolled in art classes since the age of 7, I've loved visual arts for as long as I can remember. However, I've always enjoyed challenges and problem solving, and when I became 
            really interested in mechanical/industrial design and robotics in high school, I knew I wanted to pursue an engineering degree. At the same time, my passion for the visual arts has never faded 
            and drives me to continuously improve as an artist and designer.  
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">
    Although being a full-time student takes up a lot of time, whenever I can, I'm drawing, developing, or designing my next personal project. I'm an avid learner and I pay a lot of attention to detail, 
            which fuels my enthusiasm when it comes to putting my best work forward.
    </p>
